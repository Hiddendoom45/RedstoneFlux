Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2020.09.04
  Changes:
    - Add Krastorio 2 biomass into infusion recipes

  Fixes:
    - Infusion recipes are no longer automatically unlocked (issue in control script)
      It should now work properly unlocking new ores if tech is already researched.
    - Redstone processing technology requires pulverizer/crusher to be researched if SE or K2 is enabled.

Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2020.09.04
  Fixes:
    - New infusion recipes are unlocked if tech is researched - for existing saves when
      additional ores from other mods are added.

  Changes:
    - Updated ore generation function
    - Add compatability with Krastorio 2 and Space Exploration. 
      Use pulverizers(SE), or crushers(K2) to make redstone dust.
      Add infusion recipes for all ores added by the two mods, imersite and Vulcanite are
      more efficient as they have some additional energy value based on the products they're used in.
  
  Balancing:
    - Reduce costs of some technologies to be more in line with similar technologies at the same tier
    - Nerf Redstone Generator, only 50% effective, somewhat more balanced compared to early game power generation
    - Increase redstone crystal fuel value to offset redstone generator nerf and to make 
      redstone dust -> redstone crystal -> generator process a net positive in power
    - Redstone crystals are needed for infusion recipes as a catalyst, avg 1 used per 100GJ produced.
      Forces the stupidly long and cannot be sped up redstone crystalization recipe to be used 
      which is the main drawback to balance things.
    - Reduce redstone crystalization time by 50% as it's being shoehorned into infusion.

  Locale:
    - Fix some missing locales

  Migrations:
    - Changed ore infusion name format
