## Redstone Flux

This mod adds redstone, a new resource that can be used to transfer and produce a lot of energy. 
Loosely based on the redstone flux system in the minecraft thermal expansion mod.

### New Ores

Glowing redstone deposits

### New power generation

**Redstone Generator/Furnace** - early game power generation, provides 2MW of power by burning redstone and its derivatives. Its cheap cost is offset by the need to expore beyond the starting area to find any redstone deposits.

**Survivalist Redstone Generator** - early game power generation, provides 200kW of power, 4x more efficient than the redstone generator.

**Redstone Flux Generator** - mid-late game power generation, provides 50MW of power by burning redstone energy cells. Limited by slow redstone crystal production. Unlocking redstone infusion effectively allows energy to be to be extracted from any raw resource.

**High Temperature Flux Generator** - mid-late game power generation, provides 200MW of power by burning redstone energy cells. It is less efficient than the flux generator and only produces power if it is needed.

**Heated Redstone Flux Generator** - late game power generation, requires 300MW of heat from a nuclear reactor or other buildings to work. Produces 780 MW when supplied with redstone flux and 319MW when supplied with destabilized redstone. The generator is 150% efficient when using redstone flux, and destabilized redstone is returned from the process. Using destabilized redstone will consume it, but it is much more compact than cooling a reactor with water.



### Planned Features

#### Sometime in the future
- Configuration options and customizability
- Compatability with bob and angels, and other mods that add new resources. 
- Custom sprites - priority for the redstone generators as they use tinted furnace sprites that don't make as much sense as the other stuff.
