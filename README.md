#### Redstone Flux

This mod adds redstone, a new resource that can be used to transfer and produce a lot of energy. 
Loosely based on the redstone flux system in the minecraft thermal expansion mod.

##### New Ores

##### New power generation

**Redstone Generator/Furnace** - early game power generation, provides 4MW of power by burning redstone and its derivatives. Its cheap cost is offset by the need to expore beyond the starting area to find any redstone deposits.

**Redstone Flux Generator** - mid-late game power generation, provides 100MW of power by burning redstone energy cells. Limited in the mid game by slow redstone crystal production. Unlocking redstone infusion effectively allows energy to be to be extracted from any raw resource.



##### Planned Features

###### Very soon
- Add compatability with Krastorio 2 and Space Exploration, raw resources can be converted and use crushers to create redstone dust


###### Sometime in the future
- Compatability with bob and angels, and other mods that add new resources. 
- Endgame power production, heat flux -> turbine perhaps.
- Custom sprites - priority for the redstone generators as they use tinted furnace sprites that don't make as much sense as the other stuff.
